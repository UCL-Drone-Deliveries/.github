## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the GitHub organization for a project undertaken as part of [UCL's COMP0101](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/COMP0101) and [COMP0102](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/COMP0102) modules.
It contains relevant work outputs/deliverables for both the requirements analysis and software architecture as well as the actual implementation of the project.

Access is currently on a members-only basis.
